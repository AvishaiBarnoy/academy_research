# To Do:
## Web App
1. add more colors to sankey plot to account for extra physics departments (Haifa, OpenU)
2. add women by absolute number by subject and institute: radio button to switch between them
    implement in external function
3. edit column_plot script to have one plotting function for each case and it switches according
    to relevant input parameters

## Data
1. make list of missing data columns for each institute (then add this to web app to-do)
2. automatic script to generate flow matrix (input for sankey) from tabular data
3. correlation between precentage of PIs trained and preference of graduates from the same institute
4. add Haifa and OpenU university for physics
5. add Haifa and OpenU university for chemistry
6. add Haifa and OpenU to women STEM
