### Analysis

> Not all who wander are lost

We can see that the older institutes (HUJI, Technion, WIS, TAU) having the a higher (or same as for Technion)
precentage of PI's that graduated from their own ranks, while for the younger institutes (BIU, BGU, Ariel) WIS
graduates take the majority. WIS trained the most chemists, 58 or 29%, with HUJI not far behind with 50 or 25%.
Then comes Technion with 24 (12%) and TAU 20 (10%).

It seems that less chemsitry faculty came from the USSR and although they are of the older layer of faculty members
they only account for 2% (5.6% in physics).

There is a correlation coefficient of 0.97 between absolute department size and the number of faculty the department
trained. The correlation between the self preference and faculty trained is 0.88.

### Thoughts
Why do we see such trends? Is this a relevant metric to compare universities?

Unlike for physics, I managed to get data for 94% of chemistry faculty. Though data about trained chemists in other
faculties is still unavilable.
