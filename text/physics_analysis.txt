### Analysis
Each institute (except Ariel and BGU) has the highest precentage of researchers from the same institue.
This would make sense as researchers already know the candidate and if he's goog enough he will be accepted.
I don't understand why in BGU only 5% of the physics faculty studied at BGU. Ariel makes sense as it is still
a very young institution. On the other side there is WIS with 54% faculty who studied at WIS. HUJI is at 30% HUJI
and 30% WIS, while TAU and Technion have a higher precentage of TAU and Technion than WIS recpetvially.
        
Looking at raw numbers WIS trained 38% of Israeli trained physicists, TAU coming $2^{nd}$ with 23%. When on takes
into account people who studied abroad the number changes, yet WIS still holds the lead.

There is still a strong presence of professors who studied at the USSR being 5.6% of the faculty. Where BIU
having 13% and TAU, WIS, and HUJI having only 2% USSR faculty. This also is not suprising and these faculty
members are mostly at the
ages of 60.
        
### Thoughts
Why do we see such trends? Is this a relevant metric to compare universities?

This data is incomplete, how many physcists work in other faculties? Maybe WIS is extremly good ad training
physicists that get into physics departments while the Technion trains those who get into Life Sciences departments?
This will be partly answered when I will have the time to analyze the chemistry departments data.
        
What is the variance of PhD students quality between institutes? Students tend inertially contniune to grad school
at the same institute where they did their undergraduate studies. How do students choose where to study their bachelors
degree? So many questions left unanswered, but they are vital for the flourish of an institution as without good grad
students research cannot move forward.
Finally, as in every competitive field the fight is not over students, but over the good ones.
