    # About
    
    My name is Avishai Barnoy, living in Jerusalem and a father of two mongrels. I like cooking,
    knitting, reading, specializing in terrible dad jokes. I graduated with an MSc in computational
    chemistry from the Hebrew University writing my theses under the supervision of Prof. Igor
    Shapiro. I am currently pursuing a PhD in theoretical biophysics at Tel-Aviv University under
    the supervision of Prof. Misha Kozlov.

    I was told by a friend that most professors in physics did their post-doc at the US and that
    doing a post-doc in Europe was shooting yourself in the leg as it is percieved inferiro. I did
    the terrible mistake and decided to gather data and hence this project was born.
    At some point I also decided to check the number of female PI in the different STEM departments
    and that is when the gender project came to be.
