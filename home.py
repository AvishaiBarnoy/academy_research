st.markdown("""
    This project presents my (Avishai Klein Barnoy) investigations into the Israeli academics, specifically
    in the natural sciences, math, and CS.
    
    The project has two main branches:
    1. Mobility in exact science, mostly where PI's did their PhD, post-doc, and where they got their
        tenure track position.
    2. Women in faculties - very much under construction.
    3. Graduation - under construction, but will include the yearly trend of undergrads and graudate students
        by institution and subject.
    4. network - under construction, network analysis of the mobility data

    I don't have a catchy name but this is my investigation into Israeli natural science faculties.
    But if you do I will be happy to hear your suggestions

    ### Want to help?
    - Check out the missing data, maybe you know something that's missing that I don't!
    - Suggest some analysis
    - Find a cool name for the project

    Feel free to contact me on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/avishai231) account with anything from "let's sit
    for a coffee" to detailed suggestions for further analysis and expansion of the project. Or, you can open a PR
    or and issue on the [github repository](https://github.com/avishai231/academy_research) for the project.
