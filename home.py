st.markdown("""
    This project presents my (Avishai Klein Barnoy) investigations into the Israeli academics, specifically
    in the natural sciences, math, and CS.
    
    The project has two main branches:
    1. Mobility in exact science, mostly where PI's did their PhDs and post-doc
    2. Women in faculties - very much under construction

    I don't have a catchy name but this is my investigation into Israeli natural science faculties.
    But if you do I will be happy to hear your suggestions

    ### Want to help?
    - Check out the missing data, maybe you know something that's missing that I don't!
    - Suggest some analysis 

    ### Contact
    Feel free to contact me on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/avishai231) account with anything from "let's sit for a coffee"
    to detailed suggestions for further analysis and expansion of the project.
